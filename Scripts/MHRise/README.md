# MHRise trajectory recorder

`MHGZ_AerialTrajectoryRecorder.lua` is a read-only REFramework utility for
recording Monster Hunter Rise hunter movement. Press `F9` to begin and press it
again to stop. A red `[REC]` label stays in the top-left while recording; start
and stop each show a confirmation bar. Each capture writes samples and events
CSV files under `reframework/data/MHGZ_AerialTrajectoryRecorder`.

Press `F8` once at idle and again in each animation phase to write read-only
motion-probe snapshots in the same directory. Each report lists the reflected
motion/animation/frame/time/rate/blend candidates reachable from the master
hunter and its GameObject components. It does not call those candidate methods
or write to game state.

The source script belongs in this repository; the installed copy belongs in
the game's `reframework/autorun` directory. It records the master hunter's
actual world Transform every rendered game frame. Timing uses
`via.Application.get_UpTimeSecond`; it neither changes game state nor
reads/writes the save file. Monster Hunter Rise's world-up axis is `Y`, so
`vertical_phase` is derived from `velocity_y`.
